                    <p>Core Values Matter – These three words are the mantra for the Flyin Ryan Hawks Foundation.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>The 14 Core Principles for Living, as written down by Ryan Hawks before his death, provided him with a compass to guide his decision making, whether in sports, school, relationships or other aspects of daily living.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>People with an established, self-composed set of Core Values have a touchstone, a reference point for making decisions, big and small.</p>

                    <p>Ryan Hawks was a dynamic human being, with a passion and love for the mountains and skiing. He lived a fulfilling life, which was dominated by fun, adventure, and determination. Although he lived only 25 short years, he lived every minute of his life.</p>

                    <p>Not long after his death, the following list was discovered on Ryan’s computer. These Core Values reflect the way he lived his life; they were his guiding principles for decision making, relationships and all aspects of his life.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Ryan’s Core Values statement provided much of the inspiration that drives the mission of the Flyin Ryan Hawks Foundation to help people discover and enumerate their own core values. These are the values by which he lived:</p>
